## 📣 Where to Find Contributors

### 1. **Reddit** (Highest Potential)

**Subreddits to Post In:**
```
Primary Targets:
- r/cryptocurrency - 8M+ members, general crypto audience
- r/CryptoTechnology - 260K+, technical audience
- r/rust - 360K+, Rust developers
- r/programming - 6M+, general programmers

Secondary Targets:
- r/Bitcoin - Will appreciate the Bitcoin-like economics
- r/blockchain - Technical blockchain community
- r/coding - Learning programmers
- r/learnrust - Rust learners
- r/cryptodevs - Crypto developers
- r/mathematics - Fractal geometry enthusiasts
```

**Sample Reddit Post:**

```markdown
Title: I built a blockchain where currency is fractal triangles (open source, Rust)

Body:
I've been working on a novel blockchain that uses Sierpinski triangles
(fractal geometry) as the fundamental unit of value instead of coins.

Key features:
- Currency = geometric triangles with real area
- Transactions = subdivide/transfer triangles (fractal patterns)
- Bitcoin-like economics (420M supply cap, halving every 210k blocks)
- Written in Rust with full P2P networking
- MIT licensed, open source

Instead of "sending 1 BTC", you're transferring a triangular region
of the fractal space. Mining creates new triangular area.

It's functional right now - you can mine blocks, transfer triangles,
and run nodes. Looking for contributors interested in:
- Blockchain tech
- Fractal geometry
- Rust development
- Novel crypto-economics

Happy to answer questions! This is a solo project (with AI assistance)
so far, would love to build a community around it.

### 2. **Hacker News** (Technical Audience)

**Show HN Post:**
```
Title: Show HN: Sierpinski Triangle Blockchain – Fractal geometry as currency

I've built a blockchain where the currency is fractal triangles instead
of coins. Written in Rust, MIT licensed, fully functional with P2P
networking and Bitcoin-like economics (halving, 420M supply cap).

The unique part: transactions subdivide Sierpinski triangles following
fractal math rules. Each "coin" is a geometric shape with coordinates
and provable area.

Looking for feedback and contributors! Built solo (with AI) so far.

**Sample Tweets:**
```
Tweet 1:
What if cryptocurrency was made of fractal triangles instead of coins?

I built it. Open source, Rust-based, Bitcoin-like economics.

Mine blocks → earn triangular area
Transfer triangles → fractal subdivision

Subject: Open source blockchain project using fractal geometry

Hi [Professor/Club],

I've developed an open-source blockchain that uses Sierpinski
triangles (fractal geometry) as currency. It's written in Rust and
implements Bitcoin-like economics.

I thought your students might find it interesting as:
- A novel application of fractal math
- A complete blockchain implementation in Rust
- An opportunity to contribute to an early-stage project

GitHub: [link]
Documentation: [link]

Would you be interested in sharing this with your students or
incorporating it into a course project?

Best regards,
[Your name]
